## Part 1: The Gateway to Enterprise Logistics (0:00 - 1:00)

| Visual Action | Professional Narration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **0:00** Start on the **Login Page**. Hover the cursor over the "Email" and "Password" fields to show high-contrast focus states. | "In the sophisticated world of global logistics, fragmented data leads to operational paralysis. Welcome to FleetEdge: the next-generation Command System designed to transform raw telemetry into actionable intelligence." |
| **0:20** Click the **"Continue with Google"** button. After the redirect, pause on the **Role Selection** screen. | "We begin with high-assurance identity. Built on Clerkâ€™s enterprise infrastructure, FleetEdge ensures that every user is verified and placed into their specific operational context from the very first click." |
| **0:40** Slowly hover over the **Administrator** and **Fleet Manager** cards. Select **Administrator**. | "Our intelligent onboarding flow requires users to select their functional role, allowing the entire interface to dynamically adapt permissions and modules through our robust Role-Based Access Control matrix." |

## Part 2: The Command Center Perspective (1:00 - 2:00)

| Visual Action | Professional Narration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1:00** Arrive at the **Dashboard Overview**. Hover over the "Active Fleet" and "Alerts" summary cards. | "Upon entry, the Administrator is met with the Command Dashboardâ€”a unified cockpit for high-level decision makers. Here, we aggregate total fleet success, health metrics, and pending maintenance into a singular, high-density view." |
| **1:20** Click the **"Analytics"** tab. Hover over some chart placeholders or stats to show the "live" interactive feel. | "Moving beyond simple counts, our Analytics layer provides a deep dive into historical performance, allowing management to identify bottlenecks and optimize asset utilization in real-time." |
| **1:40** Click the **"Live Map"** tab. Show the map breaking out to full-width (the negative margin effect). | "Our 'Live Map' view leverages the full available real-estate of the display, providing a seamless transition from data metrics to geospatial reality without losing operational focus." |

## Part 3: Real-Time Geospatial Intelligence (2:00 - 3:30)

| Visual Action | Professional Narration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **2:00** Click **"Mission Control"** in the sidebar. Wait for the map and radar sweep to initialize. | "The true power of FleetEdge resides in Mission Control. Weâ€™ve moved away from static logs to a real-time geospatial engine powered by Leaflet and OpenStreetMap. Every vehicle in your fleet is treated as a live telematic node." |
| **2:30** Hover over different **Vehicle Markers**. Point out the teal (active) vs amber (maintenance) markers. | "Notice the high-contrast status coding. A single hover reveals a detailed telemetry card: drive identity, speed, and real-time fuel reserves. This allows dispatchers to assess fleet state instantly, without ever leaving the primary view." |
| **3:00** Click the **"New Mission"** button. Open the dispatch modal and hover over the dark-themed dropdowns. | "Mission deployment is handled via a unified dispatch workflow. By assigning specific assets and operators through our professional, system-wide themed components, we ensure data integrity and operational efficiency from launch to completion." |
| **3:15** Click the **"Emergency Broadcast"** button and hover over the confirmation state. | "For high-stakes incidents, our Emergency Broadcast protocol allows for instant, fleet-wide notifications, ensuring that critical safety updates reach every operator in milliseconds." |

## Part 4: Financial Intelligence & Auditing (3:30 - 4:30)

| Visual Action | Professional Narration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **3:30** Navigate to the **Expenses** page. | "Operational scale requires rigorous financial oversight. FleetEdge bridges the gap between field activity and the bottom line through our Financial Intelligence hub." |
| **3:50** Hover over the **Active Budgets** card to show the three specialized progress bars. | "We track expenditures across three critical pillars: Fuel, Maintenance, and Operations. These live budget guardrails provide instant visual feedback on spending trends against monthly organizational thresholds." |
| **4:10** Scroll through the **Expense Table**. Highlight the **Trip ID** column in one of the rows. | "The key innovation here is correlation. Every operational cost is tied directly to a specific Mission ID, creating a transparent audit trail that eliminates financial ambiguity and ensures every dollar is accounted for." |

## Part 5: Asset Integrity & Professional Stack (4:30 - 5:30)

| Visual Action | Professional Narration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **4:30** Click on **Vehicles** hub. Briefly scroll through the asset list. | "Behind the scenes, we manage a comprehensive Asset Registry. Every vehicle's lifecycleâ€”from registration to retirementâ€”is tracked with zero-latency updates, ensuring your fleet stays operational and compliant." |
| **4:50** Briefly show the **Drivers** hub. Focus on the status badges (operational/on-break). | "Our Personnel Hub further manages your most valuable resource: your operators. By syncing driver availability with mission needs, we optimize human capital and reduce deployment friction." |
| **5:10** Slowly navigate back to **Mission Control** for the final visual sweep. | "Built on a modern enterprise stack featuring React, Node, and Clerk Security, FleetEdge is engineered for high-performance and future scalability. Our roadmap includes predictive AI maintenance and automated route optimization." |

## Part 6: The Outro (5:30 - 6:00)

| Visual Action | Professional Narration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **5:30** Let the **Mission Control Radar** sweep continue on screen. Slowly move the mouse off-screen. | "FleetEdge isn't just a management tool; it's a force multiplier for modern enterprise logistics. Secure, real-time, and data-driven. This is the new standard in fleet intelligence." |
| **5:50** Fade to black or show the FleetEdge logo. | "Command the Future. Thank you." |

## Final Recording Notes
- **Pacing**: Use the 5-6 minute duration to breathe. Don't rush through the map tooltips; let the judge see the data.
- **Micro-animations**: The project features many hover effects on cards and buttons. Moving the mouse intentionally over these elements highlights the "premium" feel of the code.
- **Resolution**: Use 1080p or 4K. Keep the `npm run dev` console hidden.
- **Tech Mention**: You don't need to show code. Mentioning the stack (React, Node, Clerk) in the narration is enough to prove technical depth.
